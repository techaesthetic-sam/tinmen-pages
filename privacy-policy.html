    <h1>Tinmen — Privacy Policy (Beta)</h1>
    <p class="small"><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Tinmen</strong> ("we", "our", "us"). Tinmen is a community platform for sharing homemade meals in your neighbourhood. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about users of the Tinmen mobile app and related services (the "Service"), why we collect it, how we use and share it, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Service. The types of information we collect include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, phone number, profile photo, and any information you provide when you register or edit your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication data:</strong> password (securely hashed)</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> approximate or precise device location (when you grant permission) to discover nearby spots and show delivery/pickup locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Listings & content:</strong> menu items, dish descriptions, photos (including AI-generated dish images), spot information, and any content you post.</li>
      <li><strong>Orders & transactions:</strong> order history, items ordered, pickup details, delivery locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> chat messages between users and chefs, support requests, and any content you send via in-app chat.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> device type, operating system, app version, crash logs, analytics, and interactions with the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Push notification tokens:</strong> to send you notifications if you opt in.</li>
      <li><strong>Device identifiers & diagnostics:</strong> advertising identifiers (if used), IP address, and diagnostic logs to help troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating and improving the Service (search, listings, chef tools).</li>
      <li>Processing and managing orders, payments, refunds and disputes.</li>
      <li>Communicating with you (order updates, support replies, security notices).</li>
      <li>Personalising your experience (recommended spots, followed spots, notifications).</li>
      <li>Ensuring safety and preventing abuse (fraud detection, content moderation).</li>
      <li>Conducting analytics and product improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With other users:</strong> When you place an order or post a listing, certain details (name, pickup location, order items) will be shared with the relevant chef or spot as necessary to complete the transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who provide hosting, payment processing, analytics, and messaging services (e.g., payment gateways, cloud hosting, push notification providers). These providers are authorized to use your data only as needed to provide these services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to respond to valid legal requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>The app may include third-party SDKs (maps). These third parties may collect or receive information directly from your device. Review their privacy policies for details. If you need a list of SDKs we use, contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data; some information may remain in backups or be retained for legal or legitimate business purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access or update:</strong> You can view and update your profile information in the app settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You may opt in or out of push notifications through device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data (encrypted transport, access controls, hashing of passwords). However, no system is completely secure — report suspected breaches to us immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's policy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the local minimum age where applicable). We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child under the minimum age has provided us with information, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>9. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We will protect transferred data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes, we will provide notice in the app or by other means. The "Effective date" at the top will reflect the last update.</p>
