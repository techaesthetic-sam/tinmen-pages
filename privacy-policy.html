    <h1>Tinmen Kitchen — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Effective date: January 18, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Tinmen ("we", "our", "us"). Tinmen is a community platform for sharing homemade meals in your neighbourhood. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about users of the Tinmen mobile app and related services (the "Service"), why we collect it, how we use and share it, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Service. The types of information we collect include:</p>

      <li><strong>Listings & content:</strong> Menu items, dish descriptions, photos (including AI-generated dish images), and any content you post.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice recordings:</strong> Audio recordings you submit when answering interview questions during chef or delivery person signup. These recordings are transcribed using AI services and used to generate your profile bio.</li>
      <li><strong>Orders & transactions:</strong> Order history, items ordered, pickup details, delivery locations, and payment instructions you provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Chat messages between users and chefs, support requests, and any content you send via in-app chat.</li>

      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Device type, operating system, app version, crash logs, analytics, and interactions with the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Push notification tokens:</strong> To send you notifications if you opt in.</li>
      <li><strong>Device identifiers & diagnostics:</strong> IP address and diagnostic logs to help troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating and improving the Service (search, listings, chef tools).</li>
      <li>Processing and managing orders and disputes.</li>
      <li>Generating AI content such as dish images for menu items, transcribing voice recordings, and creating profile bios from your interview answers.</li>
      <li>Communicating with you (order updates, support replies, security notices).</li>
      <li>Personalising your experience (recommended chefs, notifications).</li>
      <li>Ensuring safety and preventing abuse (fraud detection, content moderation).</li>
      <li>Conducting analytics and product improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With other users:</strong> When you place an order or post a listing, certain details (name, pickup location, order items) will be shared with the relevant chef as necessary to complete the transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who provide hosting, analytics, and messaging services. These providers are authorised to use your data only as needed to provide these services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to respond to valid legal requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services that may collect or process your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Back4App:</strong> Cloud hosting and database services (Parse Server).</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudinary:</strong> Image and audio file storage and CDN.</li>

      <li><strong>Google Maps / Apple Maps:</strong> Map display within the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Review their respective privacy policies for details on how they handle your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data; some information may remain in backups or be retained for legal or legitimate business purposes.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data (encrypted transport, access controls). Phone authentication uses one-time passwords (OTP) sent via SMS. However, no system is completely secure — report suspected breaches to us immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the local minimum age where applicable). We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child under the minimum age has provided us with information, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We will protect transferred data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes, we will provide notice in the app or by other means. The "Effective date" at the top will reflect the last update.</p>
